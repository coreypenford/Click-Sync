# Link Sync

Syncs the "visited" status of URLs between Chrome installs on different computers.

This is implemented using Chrome's Sync API, so the links you visit will be sent via your Google Account. With that in mind, you should read [Google's privacy policy](https://www.google.com.au/chrome/browser/privacy/#signed-in).

If you haven't already, it's good to setup a [Chrome Passphrase](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/165139#passphrase), which encrypts your personal data before it passes through Google's servers.
